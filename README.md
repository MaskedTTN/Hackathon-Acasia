# Hackathon-Acasia
We have designed (in progress) a web application called Acasia with the purpose to provide a comfortable interactions between those working onsite and those working at home. Our motto stays true to our beliefs that happiness comes with simplicity, in this case, having an easy to use application would leave employees with a better experience.

Features:
- We have implemented a status feature in which it displays the employees working times. In addition to this, it would use the location of the user to put the network time zone on the status. This can be used to suggest suitable times for meetings if abroad.
Employees can select to put "Do not disturb" on their status during work times, in which they will only get notifications from prioritised apps. This would prevent users working at home from getting distracted by external apps.
In order to get the employees to know each other better (and create a friendlier work environment), an idea is to have the app suggest if the user would like to go out with fellow employees with the similar breaks / shifts.

- Security :
Suggests that you should change passwords by set time intervals such as a month. Would include an external password app for authentication.

- App shows work shifts and can allow users to request changes from the app

- Includes a performance report that gives employees a clear list of objectives and awards to improve on. This also helps organisations view their progress

NOTE: Some of these are just ideas that were unfeasible to be prototyped within 24 hours and as of little experience using Flask and stuff.
